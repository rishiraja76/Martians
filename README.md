# Martians
Created a mobile game called “Martians!” as a personal project and released it to the Google Play Store.

Written in C#, developed in Unity3D engine and deployed with the help of Android Studio. 

An infinite 2D side-scroller that procedurally generates terrain requiring you to jump whenever there is a gap in between.

MUST BE USED WITH THE UNITY3D ENGINE FOR IT TO WORK
